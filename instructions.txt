-- Gameplay --
    This is a tower defense game. In this game, there will be enemies — the enemies are mushrooms.

    To defeat the enemies, you must place towers to defend your home.
    If the enemies reach the end of the path, you will lose lives.

-- Towers --
    To place a tower, you need to use money.
    You start the game with some money, and you can earn more by defeating mushrooms.

    Once you have enough money, you can click on a tower, then click on an empty square (any square that is not part of the path).
    This will place the tower.

    Different towers have different mechanics — some shoot fast, some slow, some deal splash damage, etc.

    You can upgrade towers using money as well.
    The upgrade cost will steadily increase with each level.

    When a tower reaches its max level, the "Upgrade" button will change to say "Max Upgrades."

    You can also sell a tower for half of its total cost.
